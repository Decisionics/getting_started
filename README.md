# Getting Started
Getting started in the coding world of the Decisionics Lab.

This repository contains resources and information that new team members can use to get up to speed quickly.

## Git
Git is a well established program for managing change and collaoration in code of any kind. Git helps to manage code through the use of repositories.

A repository, or repo, usually manifests in two ways:
* as a collection of code on individual machines, usually the developer's or on each computer used by a development team (a local repo)
* in a remote, shared location, such as GitHub, where individuals or team 'check-in' their changes into a collaborative project space (a remote repo)

As teams collaborate by changing, committing, pushing and merging their code together into a functional program, they do so using Git. Git is the simple program used to track changes over time, that both lives on individual machines of developers and underpins the change management strucutre used by GitHub.

To get started with Git, follow these steps:
* [install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your personal computer 
* [configure some key settings](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) for your installation
* create your first [local repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)


Once you're familiar with Git on your own machine, follow these steps to get started with GitHub:
* create a GitHub account, using either your [personal email address](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) or using a [UofT address to gain access to the Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
* [find](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys) or [create](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) an SSH key for yourself on your local machine and [add it to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) 
* learn about the general workflow for contributing to a shared project repository, known as [GitHub Flow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) or just Git Flow
* gain access to the Decisionics GitHub organization with your account by making a request (include your GitHub username and email) to Prof. Azhari 
* create a private repository in the Decisionics GitHub organization to facilitate your research needs

Now you're ready to begin researching and collaborating using code in the Decisionics Lab!

## Python
Python is a general purpose, interpreted programming language ubiquitous in modern research and development circles. Unless there is a very good reason, Python 3 is the version of the language that should be used for new development (support for Python 2 ended in 2020 and is slowly being phased out by the community).

### Learning Python
There are numerous online resources available for learning Python. 

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) has [multiple](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=B2C_NAMER_ibm-data-analyst_ibm_FTCOF_professional-certificates_country-US-country-CA&campaignid=19984826761&adgroupid=147671564346&device=c&keyword=&matchtype=&network=g&devicemodel=&adposition=&creativeid=655104109350&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=CjwKCAjw3ueiBhBmEiwA4BhspOmJHXXQxaPZXdc8M3PoeyRnzkzNUfEsUBaXxdTnwtgCLo6EiD_mZxoCLUEQAvD_BwE) [options](https://www.coursera.org/learn/get-started-with-python).

You may also choose to spend a bit of money on a more extensive course like [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/). Courses such as these can require a bit of investment, both in time and money, but pay huge dividends long term in giving a more holistic view on the basics of the language.

### Anaconda
One of the most powerful aspects of using Python is the developer's ability to access the vast world of open-source code written and maintained in Python to turbocharge development of your own applications. In order to do this, Python utilizes 'environments' where dependencies (Python packages your application depends on) are loaded into a virtual space to be allow your program to run with their use.

Anaconda is the preeminent package and environment manager used for Python today. In order to get started with Anaconda, follow these steps:
* [install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) on your developer machine
* learn about [creating and managing environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments)
* experiment with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

### Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
While Jupyter Notebooks can prove useful for experimentation and small project work, larger programs and more integrated applications often require the use of an IDE to manage the project effectively.

[Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) is a free, well maintained IDE that can be installed directly through Anaconda and is used broadly in the research community for Python development. You may also consider applications like PyCharm, Eclipse, Visual Studio and many more.
